# How to use the Croker Method

****Important**** before you start please make sure to have read the [Basic Principles](/principles/principles.md).

## Step 1 - Draw the axis

The very first thing you need to do to use the ``Croker Method`` is to draw the axis which will essentially be the space holding your ideas.

1. **Find a clear space** where you can jolt down words and ideas. Make sure you have plenty of place as in the ``Croker Method`` ideas can run like wildfire.
2. **Draw a vertical line** with arrows at both tips. This is the line which will define *orders of magnitude* for contexts.

    *Question* Are the arrows necessary? The arrows are there to mainly remind you the function of the vertical line. Context instances written on top are considered to be of a higher order than those written lower down.

## Step 2 - Place your current context in the middle of the axis

Whenever using analogies we can safely say that there are two main components:

  * The **subject** which we want to explain
  * The **analogy** which we're using the explain the subject.

Despite the fact that both the subject and the analogy are called ``contexts`` in the ``Croker Method``, *the subject* is the *starting point* of the exercise. This holds for both cases discussed in [Usages](/usages/usages.md).

As a starting point, therefore, *we place the subject in the middle* of the axis.

## Step 3 - Break down your current context into features

## Step 4 - Draw a parallel context

## Step 5 - Scale up or down

Scale the order of magnitude either in the parallel context (e.g. ``Context 2``)...
![Scale up or down - Either in the parallel context][4]

... or in the original context (e.g. ``Context 1``).
![Scale up or down - Or in the original context][5]

Similarly, you can scale low.
