# Croker Method for Harnessing Analogies
tl;dr : A methodology to harness the power of analogies, making them work for you.

## Motivation
In knowledge work one often finds themselves struggling in one of the following two situations:
  * Trying to explain a difficult, perhaps complex, concept
  * Trying to come up with new ideas on how to add some extra spice to something which is well established.
These are two natural side-effects of knowledge work, as great ideas are sometimes hard to explain or to top up. That is when, more often than not, people resort to *analogies*.

**Definition 1** Analogy (*noun*), *a comparison of one thing with another thing that has similar features; a feature that is similar*.
**Definition 2** Analogy (*noun*), *the **process** of comparing one thing with another thing that has similar features in order to **explain it***.
