# Croker Method for Harnessing Analogies
tl;dr : A methodology to harness the power of analogies, making them work for you.

## Motivation
In knowledge work one often finds themselves struggling in one of the following two situations:
  * Trying to explain a difficult, perhaps complex, concept
  * Trying to come up with new ideas on how to add some extra spice to something which is well established.
These are two natural side-effects of knowledge work, as great ideas are sometimes hard to explain or to top up. That is when, more often than not, people resort to *analogies*.

**Definition 1** Analogy (*noun*), *a **comparison** of one thing with another thing that has **similar features**; a feature that is similar*.

**Definition 2** Analogy (*noun*), *the **process** of comparing one thing with another thing that has similar features in order to **explain it***.

*Note* : I made sure to highlight the key words which I will be referring to later on in this introduction document.

Analogies, therefore, are very useful tools for knowledge workers to build and transfer knowledge. The challenge, however, is that finding the right analogy takes time and skill. Very often we start using an analogy to explain an important concept only to find ourselves in a dead-end.
 
Consider, for example, someone trying to explain Einstein's Theory of General Relativity to someone else by using an analogy. That's a great idea, until this someone chooses the *wrong* analogy which will have the receiver asking more about the analogy than on the concept itself. Possibly, they will try to find other analogies to try to converge to the same pattern, but now everything is being done in panic mode. What happened of Einstein's theory anyway?!

Many have found themselves in a similar situation. The result will be **even more confused minds** and that is something that knowledge workers are, rightly so, very much afraid of.

The ``Croker Method for Harnessing Analogies`` is aimed as a facilitatory tool for anyone who wants to make analogies work for them.

## Basic Principles

The Croker Method uses mainly 3 principles:

1. **Contexts:** It is not only contexts that knowledge workers find themselves trying to explain. There could be instances when knowledge workers need to explain processes, ideas, algorithms, and literally any piece of knowledge. In the ``Croker Method`` these are all called *contexts*. A context is a grouping of similar situations. 

  Think of the famous phrase *"All animals are equal but some are more equal than others."* There are many animals in the world, but clearly we can draw connective lines between some of them to group them in a particular category. For example, should we have a ``cat``, a ``hen`` and a ``tiger``, we can draw a line between the ``cat`` and the ``tiger`` in a category we can call ``feline animals``. Similarly, however, we can also draw a line joining ``cat`` with ``hen`` in a category we will call ``farm animals``. Both are very valid connections. In the ``Croker Method`` we call these groupings and categories are called ``contexts``.

2. **Orders of magnitude:** The relationship between elements within a context can be expressed in orders of magnitude. The weight will depend upon the situation that the knowledge worker is trying to examine.

  Back to the animal example, let us say that we're examining specifically the ``cat``. If the context was ``Animal Roles in Farms``, a higher order of ``cat`` can be a ``guard dog`` as it has a more authoritative role within the farm, while a lower order of the ``cat`` can be a ``mouse`` as many times it is an unwanted guest. Should we be seeing the ``cat`` in the context of ``Zoo`` we can say that a higher order would be a ``lama`` and an ``elephant`` while a smaller order will be a ``green finch``.

3. **Analogies as parallel contexts:** Since analogies emerge out of similar patterns in different contexts, we like to think of analogies as *parallel contexts*.

  In the animal example, a ``guard dog`` is more authoritative than a ``cat`` in an ``Animal Roles in Farms`` context just like the ``best-man`` is more authoritative than the ``waiter`` in a ``Family Wedding`` context. Both the ``guard dog`` and the ``best-man`` have a guarding role in their contexts, and hence are good analogies to each other.


## Usages

There are 2 ways in which the ``Croker Method`` can be used:

1. **A tool** which helps to bring out tacit knowledge to explicit by structuring the thoughts into visible ideas;
2. **A process** that helps knowledge workers generate ideas.
